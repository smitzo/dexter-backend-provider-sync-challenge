# Backend Assignment: Provider Sync Reliability Challenge

## Context

At Dexter Health, our backend connects with third-party healthcare software
providers and synchronizes operational care data into our internal systems.

In this assignment, you will work with a small existing Python codebase that
simulates a resident data sync from a third-party provider into a Firestore-like
repository.

The current implementation is a thin happy-path skeleton. Your job is to make
it production-grade enough to be trusted with real care data.

## Setup

Python 3.11 or newer required. On macOS and many Linux distros the system
`python3` is older than 3.11 and the editable install will fail with a
confusing setuptools error — use `python3.11` explicitly to be safe.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

No cloud accounts, Docker, Postgres, Redis, or external services. Everything
runs locally and deterministically.

After setup, `pytest` should report **6 passed, 5 failed**. That is your
starting line — the failing public tests are part of the spec.

## Your Task

Make the running sync trustworthy. The failing public tests and
`docs/PROVIDER_API.md` together describe the gap between what the starter
does and what we need.

In broad strokes:

1. **Reliability** — pagination, retries, rate-limit handling, no infinite
   loops, no silent error swallowing.
2. **Data integrity** — idempotent re-runs, no duplicate residents, no stale
   data overwriting newer internal records, partial failures must not corrupt
   valid data.
3. **Validation & mapping** — read the provider docs carefully. Some fields
   are messier than the starter assumes. Surface validation errors with
   enough context to debug. Map provider `first_name` + `lastName` into the
   internal `full_name` field.
4. **Tests** — add at least 3 meaningful tests beyond the public suite.
   Cover edge cases that aren't already exercised.
5. **Notes & decision memo** — write up your approach, tradeoffs, and the
   design decisions you made when the docs were ambiguous (see
   "Decision memo" at the bottom of this file).

## Assumptions you can make

These corners are intentionally underspecified — exactly like real provider
integrations. Pick a defensible answer and document it. You will not be
punished for a reasonable choice.

- **Stale-write protection:** treating `existing.updated_at >= incoming.updated_at`
  as "skip" is acceptable. Strict `>` is also acceptable. Be consistent.
- **Counter semantics:** `created` for fresh inserts, `updated` for
  newer-overwrites, `skipped` for stale-protected, `failed` for malformed or
  validation errors. A stale-skip increments `skipped`, not `updated=0`.
- **Retry budget:** ≥ 3 attempts on transient / 429 errors is expected.
  Exponential backoff is a plus but not required.
- **Retry timing:** the test simulator uses `retry_after = 0` so retries do
  not wait. If your retry helper layers its own backoff on top, keep the
  per-attempt sleep small (≤ ~1s) — the test grader has a per-test timeout
  and a backoff that ignores `retry_after` may flake.
- **Permanent error mid-pagination:** record it in `result.errors` and stop
  the run cleanly. Do not retry. Do not silently continue.
- **Sync entrypoint signature:** keep
  `run_sync(provider, repository) -> SyncResult` so the grading harness can
  call your code unchanged.

## Timebox

Please block a focused **4-hour window** for the assignment. The timer starts
when you open the PandaDoc briefing we sent you.

It is fine — and expected — that you make tradeoffs to fit the timebox. If
setup issues or life interruptions materially affect your available time, just
note that in your submission. Tell us what you chose to prioritise and what
you would improve with more time.

## AI Tools

You are encouraged to use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, or
similar tools. Use whatever you would use in a real job.

We evaluate the **final outcome**: reliability, data integrity, tests,
judgment, and your ability to explain the solution. We do not penalise AI
usage.

We will, however, ask you to walk through and defend your solution in the
next interview round, so make sure you understand what you submitted.

## What We Care About

- Correctness and end-to-end reliability
- Data integrity and idempotency
- Validation and graceful failure handling
- Meaningful tests, including for edge cases
- Simple, maintainable code
- Clear tradeoffs, documented decisions, and honest communication

## What We Don't Care About

- Avoiding AI tools
- Perfect architecture
- Unnecessary frameworks
- Real cloud deployment
- Building a full production system
- Adding unrelated features

## Submission

Submit either:
1. A GitHub repository link (private or public, both fine), or
2. A zip file with your solution.

Please include in your README:
- What you changed and why
- Tradeoffs you made
- What you would improve with more time
- How you used AI tools (if applicable) and how you verified output
- How you ran and validated your solution
- Your honest time spent

### Decision memo

Briefly answer (4-8 sentences total):

1. How did you handle the polymorphic `care_level` field documented in
   `docs/PROVIDER_API.md`?
2. When a record carries both `is_active` and `deleted_at`, which wins, and
   why?
3. Did you use `last_updated` or `last_modified_by_caregiver` for stale-write
   protection? Why?
4. **Past the table.** The Binding rules section of `docs/PROVIDER_API.md`
   resolves the documented cases. For each of the three above, name **one
   edge case the docs do NOT pin down** (e.g., an unknown `care_level`
   variant; `deleted_at` arriving in the future or being un-set on a later
   sync; a real situation in which `last_modified_by_caregiver` should
   matter for staleness) and how your code handles it.

We will challenge these decisions with a fresh provider example in the
technical interview.
